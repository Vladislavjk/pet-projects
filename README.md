## Classification on Heart Disease dataset
  * EDA, Data preprocessing (missing values, outliers, feature scaling, categorical variables).
  * Training Non-tree based algorithms (Logistic regression, KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes) and comparing ROC AUC score.
  * Training Tree based algorithms (Decision tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Catboost) and comparing ROC AUC score.
  * Tuning hyperparams for XGBoost and Catboost.

## Regression on Fish market dataset
  * EDA, Data preprocessing (missing values, feature scaling, categorical variables).
  * Training different models (DecisionTree, Linear Regression, RandomForest, KNN, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, Catboost, Lasso, Ridge, BayesianRidge, ElasticNet and HuberRegressor) and comparing RMSE and R2 metric.

## Unsupervised learning on Fashion MNIST dataset
  * Comparing Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms PCA and t-SNE.
  * Clustering using KMeans and Spectral Clustering algorithms and comparing them using ARI, AMI and other metrics.

## NLP on Language Detection dataset
  * Comparing Bag Of Words, Tf-Idf and Catboost text features.
